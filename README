Mactime is an insurmountably useful tool in a forensic investigation. When forensically analyzing a machine, date and times of every file are crucial in order to provide a timeline analysis. This is where mactime comes in. Mactime is a program that runs in a command line interface and outputs a fileâ€™s last modified, accessed, and changed times, as well as its permissions and size. Some people prefer not to use the command line, so a graphical user interface for Mac systems was created in order to welcome these people into the forensic community.
